# ccastHue

This is a very simple and very basic service that continuously monitors whether a Chromecast device is active or not. If it is active, the hue light group specified in the configuration file will be turned on off (and if the Chromecast becomes idle, the lights will turn back on)

## Usage:

Simply rename the config.sample file to config and adapt it to your needs
